%1. Introduction (1.5 pages)
%- Goals:
%- Set abstractions serve a different purpose than SAT/SMT/MC
%- Inference vs Entailment
%- Explicit vs Implicit control flow
%- Handling of quantifiers
%- Forward vs backward analysis
%- Modern set abstractions offer performance and precision
%- Set abstractions are useful for a wide variety of problems
%
%2. Overview (2 pages)
%-> a couple of examples, showing very intuitively (possibly just with pictures)
%the need for set abstractions
%Possibly:
%- a quick picture of HOO
%- a quick picture of Huisong's work
\input{overview.tex}


%3. Set Abstraction Problem (1 page)
%-> set up problem framework / why abstract domain vs other things?
%- Boolean Algebra
%- Cardinality/Value considerations
%- Forward analysis to be use as a subcomponent of other analyses
%- Abstract domain (implicit vs explicit control flow)
%- Inference (vs BAPA)
%
%4 Constructed set abstractions (5 pages)
%-> search for efficient structures and algorithms associated to them
%4.1 Lin
%4.2 QUICr
%4.3 BDD
%4.4 EQ functor
%4.5 Packing functor
%- Why packing doesn't work for BDDs in model checking, but does work here.
%
%5. Solver-based set abstractions (1.5 pages)
%-> encode problem to traditional, known problem
%5.1 SMT
%5.2 QBF
%
%
%6. Evaluation (2 pages)
%-> compare approaches in several classes of problems
%- Benchmark suites:
%- Python set tests
%- JSAna JavaScript verification
%- Memcad C data structure memory safety
%- Show:
%- Old set domains much slower
%- New set domains faster and often more precise
%- SMT doesn't scale in on these applications
%
%7. Tradeoffs/Limitations (0.5 pages)
%-> limitations and possible enhancements
%- Cardinality
%- Contents

%8. Related Work (1 page)

%9. Conclusions (0.5 pages)
